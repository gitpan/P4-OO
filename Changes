Revision history for Perl extension P4::OO.

0.00_01 2011-Jun-04 armstd@cpan.org
 - Releasing it since it seems stable at this point.  It works, if you
   can figure out how to use it. :)

0.00_02 2011-Sep-04 armstd@cpan.org
 - Added more documentation, made querying more accessible - all objects
   can $self->query() now
 - Started work on $p4Conn->runCommand(), for executing all Perforce
   commands and massaging output into P4::OO objects where possible,
   rather than making each package parse P4PERL output into P4::OO
   objects themselves.  Should provide somplicity and consistency outside
   of P4::OO::_Connection::P4PERL, which is really the goal.
