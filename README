P4-OO version 0.00_02
=====================

Welcome to P4::OO!  P4::OO provides a layer of objects on top of
P4PERL.  The idea is to bring order to managing Perforce in a
programmatic fashion, rather than simply treating Perforce as
a set of commands to be run in sequence.

This initial release is pretty limited in what it can do, but
exists as a proof of concept, hopefully to gather some more ideas
where to take it next.
